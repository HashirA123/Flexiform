EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Despite the overrepresentation of finger amputations among upper extremity amputations, progress in finger prosthesis design has been impeded by a variety of design challenges. Design approaches not only have to demonstrate extensive versatility in meeting a diverse range of amputation forms and anatomical variations, but also must replicate a variety of complex, intricate motor functions performed by the hand, proving a complex undertaking. Unfortunately, both clinical experience and current data suggest significant dissatisfaction for and rejection of finger prostheses, citing several concerns regarding inadequate fitting, functionality, aesthetics, as well as lengthy manufacturing times and high costs.
Accordingly, we developed an interactive computational platform for the generation of prosthetic sockets for patients with finger amputations. Accepting a three-dimensional scan of a patientâ€™s residual hand, our program automatically generates a template for a custom-fitted prosthetic socket and enables manual adjustments to prepare the model for 3D printing. Our solution brings immediate benefit to the clinical workflow, facilitating: (i) rapid preparation, manufacturing, and iteration of prostheses, enabling patients with recent amputations to quickly acquire a renewable prosthesis and proceed with rehabilitative treatment; (ii) minimized material cost, using only 3D printing filament; and (iii) efficient healthcare resource utilization by reducing the labor involvement of prosthetists.
